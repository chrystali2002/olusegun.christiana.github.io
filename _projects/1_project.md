This project page details the findings of the research published in **Environmental Research Letters** (2018), which investigates the critical climate risks faced by West Africa under the Paris Agreement warming targets. The study uses a multi-model ensemble of **25 Regional Climate Model (RCM)** simulations from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (**CORDEX**) to assess the impact on seasonal precipitation extremes.

### Project Methodology and Key Findings 🌍

The primary focus was on two key extreme precipitation and seasonal drought indicators: the **Maximum Number of Consecutive Dry Days (CDD)** and the **Maximum Number of Consecutive Wet Days (CWD)**, analyzed at both the **+1.5 °C** and **+2 °C Global Warming Levels (GWLs)** above pre-industrial levels.

The results show a noticeable, robust response to enhanced warming, with an overall **reduction in mean rainfall** across the region. Specifically, the models project the following:

* **Consecutive Dry Days (CDD) will increase** over the Guinea Coast, indicating a tendency toward longer and more intense dry spells.
* **Consecutive Wet Days (CWD) will decrease**, suggesting shorter rainy periods.

More than 80% of the ensemble members agree on the sign of these changes. These projected shifts are critical, as they directly influence the already fragile ecosystems and rain-fed **agriculture** in West Africa, necessitating urgent adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/) system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the structure for displaying results plots:

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/west_africa_cdd_cwd_map.jpg" title="Projected Change in Consecutive Dry Days (CDD, upper panel), and consecutive wet days (CWD, lower panel) at 2°C GWL" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>  
</div>
<div class="caption">

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite klutse2018potential %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
