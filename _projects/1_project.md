This project page details the findings of the research published in **Environmental Research Letters** (2018), which investigates the critical climate risks faced by West Africa under the Paris Agreement warming targets. The study uses a multi-model ensemble of **25 Regional Climate Model (RCM)** simulations from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (**CORDEX**) to assess the impact on seasonal precipitation extremes.

### Project Methodology and Key Findings 🌍

The primary focus was on two key extreme precipitation and seasonal drought indicators: the **Maximum Number of Consecutive Dry Days (CDD)** and the **Maximum Number of Consecutive Wet Days (CWD)**, analyzed at both the **+1.5 °C** and **+2 °C Global Warming Levels (GWLs)** above pre-industrial levels.

The results show a noticeable, robust response to enhanced warming, with an overall **reduction in mean rainfall** across the region. Specifically, the models project the following:

* **Consecutive Dry Days (CDD) will increase** over the Guinea Coast, indicating a tendency toward longer and more intense dry spells.
* **Consecutive Wet Days (CWD) will decrease**, suggesting shorter rainy periods.

More than 80% of the ensemble members agree on the sign of these changes. These projected shifts are critical, as they directly influence the already fragile ecosystems and rain-fed **agriculture** in West Africa, necessitating urgent adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Areas where at least 80% of the simulations (20 of 25) agree on the sign of the change are marked by positively sloped hatching.
