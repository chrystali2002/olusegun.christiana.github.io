## 👋 Professional Summary

Atmospheric and climate scientist with expertise in **regional climate modeling, geospatial data analysis, and climate–agriculture interactions**. Demonstrated record of interdisciplinary research, collaboration, and mentoring across Africa, Europe, and North America.

## 🔭 Research Interests

My primary research focuses on understanding and predicting climate variability and change, particularly concerning **precipitation extremes** and **climate dynamics**. I translate complex climate simulations and numerical modeling into actionable environmental insights for resilience.

**Key areas of expertise:**
* **Climate Modeling:** Regional models (CMIP6, REGCM4, WRF, CORDEX-CORE), climate simulations, and geospatial diagnostics.
* **Data Science:** Proficient in Python, R, MATLAB, ArcPy, and GIS for atmospheric and climate data analysis.
* **Applications:** Land–atmosphere interactions, climate–agriculture impacts, and data-driven approaches for environmental resilience.

**View my complete professional history, funded projects, and full publication list on my [Curriculum Vitae (PDF)]() and [Publications page](/publications/).**

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
